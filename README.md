# Resplice PWAs

Resplice => Main Resplice PWA
Common => Resplice Component Library (Svelte) & JS utilities
ReAuth => Future State

I might move the auth flow to it's own package eventually, in-case we ever want to deploy that separately, maybe to auth.resplice.com if we get into Single-Sign-On stuff.
