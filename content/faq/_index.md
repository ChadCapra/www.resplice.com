## What is Resplice? How does it work?

Resplice is an online address book that you don't have to manage or keep up-to-date, your contacts do it for you. You are in charge of your own information and can choose exactly who to share it with. You can also revoke access to your information from anyone or any group. Anytime you or one of your friends updates their phone number, address, or whatever else they shared with you, it automatically updates in your address book.

Resplice is a PWA (Progressive Web App) designed to be mobile first and will work on almost any device with an up-to-date web browser.

## Resplce looks awesome. Who is it for?

We designed Resplice with everyone in mind. For anyone who wants to have instant access to the most up-to-date information on family, friends, coworkers, and even acquaintances, Resplice is for you.

No more, "New phone who dis?" or "I lost all my numbers :( Please text me." or "What is your address again?" Just log into Resplice and all of your contacts are instantly available.

## PWA? How do I download that? How do I update that?

A PWA (Progressive Web App) is the technology behind our web application. It allows us to provide your address book offline, send you notifications, use less data, and provide greater accessibility.

You don't have to download the PWA, you just go to the website, add the app to your homescreen and BAM! the app is ready to use. No waiting for updates from the app store. Updates are applied to Resplice automatically whenever you open it while connected to the internet.

## Is it secure and safe to use?

The only data we store is the data you add to your profile. You and you alone have the power to choose exactly who sees that data.

The data we store is encrypted and salted so, even in the case of a breach, no one else can read your data.

## What Does the Future Hold for Resplice? Whatâ€™s the plan?

Right now, Resplice plans to be a complete, reliable address book that keeps you in the loop and will always be available, even offline.

We plan to add more features to the initial project, stay tuned.
